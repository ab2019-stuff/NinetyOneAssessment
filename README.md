Instructions: make sure you have the 'Code.py' and 'main.py' files along with the the txt file you would like to parse. To run the program simply go to the main class file and run in your IDE of choice. You will be prompted to enter the name of your chosen file you can enter this either in the form file or file.txt if the name is incorrect or the file cannot be found you will be asked to try again. Note that the provided Test input cases are given in the Test.txt text file provided so in order to check those simply run the program and type Test when prompted. The program will return a dictionary called 'Numbers' indexed by line number where the value corresponding to given key is a list containing the text versions of the numbers found in that list (this will be ['invalid number'] in the case of invalid or no numbers in the line of text.

Assumptions: This program can only read in text (i.e. .txt files). This code only deals with non negative integers it will assume decimals, fractions and negative numbers are invalid numbers same with comma seperated numbers e.g. 1,000 will return 'number invalid' but 1000 will return 'one thousand'. Furthermore if there is at least one invalid number on a line the data is deemed irreliable and so the program will just return['invalid number'] for the entire line. Numbers with leading 0's have the leading 0's removed before evaluations e.g 001 would be read as 'one and 0000000 would be read as 'zero' (as would 0);. An empty file will return an empty dictionary.
